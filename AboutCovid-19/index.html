 <h3>WHAT IS COVID-19</h3>

 <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>

<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>





<h3>HOW DOES IT SPREAD?</h3>

<p>Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions. These include saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets. These are released from the mouth or nose when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, for example. People who are in close contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person can catch COVID-19 when those infectious droplets get into their mouth, nose or eyes.</p>

<p>People with the virus in their noses and throats may leave infected droplets on objects and surfaces (called fomites) when they sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. Other people may become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, noses or mouths before cleaning their hands. </p>



<p>To avoid contact with these droplets, it is important to stay at least 1 metre away from others, clean hands frequently, and cover the mouth with a tissue or bent elbow when sneezing or coughing. When physical distancing (standing one metre or more away) is not possible, wearing a fabric mask is an important measure to protect others. Cleaning hands frequently is also critical.


<p>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>



<h3> WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?</h3>

<p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization. </p>

<p>Most common symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>dry cough</li>
<li>tiredness</li>
</ul>
<p>Less common symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>aches and pains</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>diarrhoea</li>
<li>conjunctivitis</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>loss of taste or smell</li>
<li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
</ul>
<p>Serious symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
<li>chest pain or pressure</li>
<li>loss of speech or movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.</p>
<p>On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</p>

<h3>SAFETY-MEASURES</h3>
<h5>Precautionary Measures</h5>
<p>The Coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted all of us around the world. In this challenging time, it is important to remember that we are in this together and must all do our part to stop the spread of this virus. To that end, our staff will work remotely and will eliminate all business travel until this immediate crisis is over.</p>

<p>As this situation evolves, we advise that everyone stay informed on the latest information communicated by their national and local governments, including the specific protection measures and procedures recommended for your area.</p>

<p><b>Below are some basic protective measures that have been provided by the World Health Organization that all would be wise to follow.</b></p>

  <h5>Health Measures </h5>
  <p>While protective measures like social distancing are necessary to keep us safe, they can also lead to other health issues. Staying indoors, limiting social interactions, eating unhealthy foods, and following stressful, virus-related news can have a cumulative negative impact on your well-being.</p>
  <p>Therefore, in addition to measures targeted at limiting the spread of the virus, it is also important to engage in behaviors that contribute to general physical and mental health.</p>
